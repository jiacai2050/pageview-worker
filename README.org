* Use at you own website
- Setup workers, refer to [[https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts/][Quickstarts · Cloudflare Workers docs]]
  - Publish [[file:worker.js]]
- Add KV binding, refer to [[https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv/][Referencing KV from Workers]]
  - Binding name is =KV= in this project.
- Add following tracking code to HTML files you want to monitor, replace =apiEndpoint= with your worker address.
  #+begin_src js
const apiEndpoint = 'https://pageview-demo.jiacai2050.workers.dev/write';
const payload = {
  'url': document.location.href,
  'title': document.title,
  'referrer': window.frames.top.document.referrer,
};
fetch(`${apiEndpoint}?${new URLSearchParams(payload)}`, {mode: 'no-cors'})
  .catch(console.log);
  #+end_src
- Then when visit HTML, following information will be saved KV via workers:
  - URL
  - Title
  - Referrer
  - User-Agent
  - IP
  - Country
  - City
- [[file:index.html]] is provided to view saved pageviews.
